#Room Experiences (REx)

REx is an experiment attempting to advance the design space of applications and
games running on TV set-top box (Android TV in this case).  REx takes advantage
of an underutilized application architucture to provide rich experience shared
by the entire room.

REx pairs an Android TV application with mobile client applications running on
consumer phones (Android and iOS) or custom hardware.  The desired effect is
similar to Nintendo's goals with the Wii U platform.  But the goal for REx is
to provide a low barrier to entry by utilizing existing commodity phones and
set-top boxes.

For more information about how a REx application works see the design
[document](docs/design.md).
